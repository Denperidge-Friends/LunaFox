Hi Foxies!!

I have been Chitstreaming for SO long. And it has been so much fun !! The people I got to meet thanks to what I do (and especially with Alien Harvest Crossing Valley!) have been some of the most wonderful people I have gotten to meet and most fun drones I've gotten to kitbash. (<3 you Plague_Rat!!!)

But truth be told, there might be more out there. Living in The Crown has been great. But by Her Fostering Mother, the wide outreach I've been *blessed* with also means that now I see how dire things are for some of you. I had to **convince** people to take my tips when ordering parts and stuff, because while they were talented, they were in such dire situations that they just had to bring in customers as fast as possible and the best way to do that is by labouring yourself for nOTHING AND THAT'S NOT GOOD

Will I be able to make any dent into this? Probably not. But it's worth a shot, right? What kind of Chitstreamer would I be if I didn't try!!  

So I've been looking into ways to get around more. It'll take a bit of my streaming hours, so sorry about that! But I'll try to give check-ins and let you all in on things. If I'm not doing some super classified cool stuff.

If you see me across the stars, please do come say hi!
Unless I'm being chased by some people. Then don't. Stay safe until I'm done and then come say hi!!

Have a good moon!
